/**
 * [SequenceRandom] is an implementation of the [GameRandom] interface that allows for deterministic
 * random number generation based on a predefined sequence of integers. This class is particularly
 * useful in scenarios where predictable and repeatable random values are required.
 *
 * ## Key Features
 * - **Predefined Sequence**: The core of this class is a mutable list of integers (`sequence`),
 *   which serves as the source for all generated random numbers. Users can either provide an
 *   initial sequence or fill it out as needed. (though it should be noted that the maximum capacity
 *   of the list cannot be exceeded)
 * - **Controlled Access**: The class maintains separate indices for reading and writing values
 *   (`readerIndex` and `writerIndex`). This ensures that random numbers are consumed in the order
 *   they were added, providing a clear and controlled flow of values.
 * - **Idiomatic Access**: The `next` and `then` properties provide a more idiomatic way to set the
 *   next value in the sequence. This can enhance code readability by emphasizing the chronological
 *   order of events in the sequence.
 * - **Reset Capability**: The `reset` function allows users to reset the reading and writing
 *   indexes, effectively reusing the sequence from the beginning without the need to create a new
 *   instance.
 *
 * ## Example Usage
 *
 * ```
 * // Initialize with a predefined sequence of size [DEFAULT_CAPACITY].
 * val random = SequenceRandom()
 *
 * // Set specific values in the sequence.
 * random.next = 42
 * random.then = 99 // Equivalent to random.next = 99
 *
 * // Generate random numbers.
 * val value1 = random.of(100)       // Will return 42
 * val value2 = random.of(50, 100)   // Will return 99
 *
 * // Reset the sequence for reuse if needed.
 * random.reset()
 * ```
 *
 * ## Notes
 * - **Index Bounds**: The class ensures that any attempt to read beyond the available sequence or
 *   write beyond its capacity will throw an [IndexOutOfBoundsException].
 * - **Deterministic Behavior**: Since the sequence of random values is predetermined, the behavior
 *   of [SequenceRandom] is fully deterministic, meaning the same sequence of operations will always
 *   yield the same results.
 *
 * @param sequence A mutable list of integers that serves as the source for random values. If not
 *   provided, a sequence of size [DEFAULT_CAPACITY] filled with zeros is created.
 * @constructor Creates a [SequenceRandom] instance with a predefined sequence of integers.
